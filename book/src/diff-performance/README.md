# Performance

dipa wants to be useful in real time applications.

This means that we want the amount of time that it takes to delta encode a data structure should be as low as possible,
without sacrificing on the focus of generating incredibly tiny diffs.

The sections in this chapter discuss different diffing performance related topics, and also provide tips on how to
maximize diffing performance in your own applications.
